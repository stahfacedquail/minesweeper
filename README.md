# minesweeper
After failing my Minesweeper project in uni, I gave it another go.  Also, when I started the project, the Minesweeper on Windows didn't yet have the guarantee of starting a game on a non-bomb :|  So that spurred me on to build my own and ALWAYS make sure the first block is empty tee hee hee \:D/

# How to run the game
Download Minesweeper.jar (in the src folder) and open the file - voila!
